## Overview

CARDIA is a computational tool designed to process and analyze electrocardiogram (ECG) signals to detect heartbeats (R-peaks) and calculate heart rate. The project demonstrates the effectiveness of parallel computing in signal processing applications, achieving significant speedups through OpenMP parallelization.

The implementation follows the classic **Pan-Tompkins algorithm**, a widely-used method in biomedical signal processing for reliable QRS complex detection.

## Algorithm

The Pan-Tompkins algorithm processes raw ECG signals through the following stages:

### 1. **Bandpass Filtering**
Removes baseline wander and high-frequency noise using moving-average-based high-pass (~5 Hz) and low-pass (~15 Hz) filters to isolate the QRS frequency band.

### 2. **Derivative**
Computes the first derivative to emphasize the steep slopes characteristic of QRS complexes.

### 3. **Squaring**
Squares each sample point-by-point to:
- Make all values positive
- Enhance signal peaks
- Amplify higher frequencies

### 4. **Moving Window Integration**
Applies a moving window integrator to generate a feature waveform representing the energy of the QRS complex.

### 5. **Adaptive Peak Detection**
Uses dynamic thresholding based on signal statistics (mean + 1.5σ) with a refractory period (~200ms) to identify R-peaks while preventing duplicate detections.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tarun-varier/cardia.git
cd cardia
```

### Compile the Programs

#### Serial Version
```bash
g++ -O3 -std=c++11 cardia_serial.cpp -o cardia_serial -fopenmp
```

#### Parallel Version
```bash
g++ -O3 -std=c++11 cardia_parallel.cpp -o cardia_parallel -fopenmp
```

**Compiler Flags Explained:**
- `-O3`: Aggressive optimization for maximum performance
- `-std=c++11`: Enable C++11 features

---

## Usage

### Basic Execution
```bash
./cardia_serial <path_to_ecg_data.csv>
./cardia_parallel <path_to_ecg_data.csv>
```

### Example
```bash
./cardia_parallel data/ecg100.csv
```

### Input Format
The program expects a CSV file with one ECG sample value per line:
```
-0.145
-0.150
-0.160
...
```

The default sampling frequency is **360 Hz** (MIT-BIH standard). Modify the `fs` variable in `main()` if using different datasets.

### Output
```

## Performance

### Optimizations in `cardia_parallel.cpp`

| Optimization | Impact |
|--------------|--------|
| **Loop Fusion** | Combines derivative and squaring into one pass, eliminating intermediate vector |
| **OpenMP Parallelization** | Distributes element-wise operations across CPU cores |
| **Efficient CSV Parsing** | Uses `strtod` instead of `stringstream` for ~30% faster I/O |
| **Memory Pre-allocation** | Reserves vector capacity to avoid reallocations |

### Typical Speedup
- **Small datasets** (< 10K samples): 1.5-2x faster
- **Large datasets** (> 100K samples): 3-5x faster on quad-core systems

*Note: Speedup varies based on CPU architecture and thread count.*
